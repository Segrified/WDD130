    <p>Hello, I am Tucker Giovo, a Computer Science Major. I currently live in Utah, working in IT for Ogden City. I spend a lot of my free time playing games or programming.</p>
        <p>Web design could be helpful for a few reasons. Learning about more types of coding, and understanding how to make webpages both could contribute to a future career.
