    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the website is to make the services provided by Dry Oar accessible to more people.
        It allows customers to schedule rafting trips ahead of time, including renting equipment, or
        hiring an instructor. This will help with the problem of long wait times at our locations due
        to a customer having to decide what they want after arriving.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Anyone could be a potential customer of Dry Oar. From solo enthusiasts, to families, to business
        teams, we have equipment and instruction for all levels of experience. Accessing the site will
        usually be done by those looking to check pricing options or schedule events. This should reduce
        the amount of people that have to change plans due to unknown prices or long wait times. It is
        expected most people will access the site from a desktop computer, though some may access from a
        mobile device.</p>
