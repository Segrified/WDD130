      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to the site mostly to find out information about the arcade. The main things that people will be looking for are the hours, current games available, and special events. The hours will simply cover the weekly schedule, and special holidays that may change its open time. There will be a rotation of games in the arcade to keep it interesting. It’s not the kind that you win tickets from the machines to trade for prizes, so what games are currently available makes a big difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        There will also be the possibility of special events, commonly party reservations or tournaments. For party events, a portion of the arcade, or even the whole building may be closed to public access. Alternatively, tournaments could be something people want to watch or sign up for, so it would need information about that. There would be a page dedicated to information and sign up for events
      </p>
      <p>
        The other page will be for reservations. People will be able to reserve a portion or whole of the arcade on a per hour charge, as long as there are not conflicting events. The page will include available days and times, as well as costs, which could be different depending on the day. Early on weekdays when school is in will probably cost less than peak times on weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hours may not be as vital to a person’s reason for visiting the site, since you can usually find that information on Google. However, that will often not be updated for holidays, and definitely won’t have reservation or event schedules. That makes actually going to the site the best way to know when you can go. The more important thing people would visit the website for is to make the reservations or sign up for events.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main page might also have a bit about the owner, the vision of the arcade, and some history. Arcades like that are not as common anymore, so there would probably be some interesting story about it. There also could have been things that have happened there, like if a record was broken, or if the first arcade machine of a certain game was there.The owner has had the arcade since the founding in the 70s, so there is probably some story about them and possibly complications they or the arcade have faced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The footer of each page will have contact information, like the phone number or email. Any inquiries that cannot be found through the website can be answered through these methods.

      </ul>
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        Some events may be publicly available, while others might not be. For example, a fighting game tournament might be available for anyone that wants to watch or join, but something like a world record attempt might be more private, or at least have rules that need to be observed for watchers. This will partially be described on the main page and events page. It will show up on the calendar on both, and more information can be found on the event page.

      </ul>
      <h3>Reservations</h3>
      <p>
        For birthdays, there would be a party room that can be reserved, which can have up to 4 games selected to be in there for the party. If more games than that are wanted privately, then the whole arcade can be reserved, and the reserver can select any games they want to be available. Catering is done through other services, and is not provided by the arcade itself. Usually, the catering is settled by the reserver, but if desired, it can be settled over the phone to be included. The cake follows the same process. There would also be regulations about not having any food or drink outside the party room.
